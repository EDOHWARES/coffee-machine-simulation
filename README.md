## Coffee Making Simulation (Object Oriented Version)
This is an updated version of the Coffee Making Simulation project implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. This version enhances the previous procedural implementation by organizing code into classes and leveraging the benefits of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# Features
Modularity: The project is divided into classes such as CoffeeMaker, MenuItem, Menu, MoneyMachine, etc., making it easier to understand and maintain.
Encapsulation: Object-oriented design encapsulates related data and functions into objects, promoting cleaner code and reducing complexity.
Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of specialized classes (e.g., EspressoMachine inheriting from CoffeeMachine) with shared attributes and behaviors.
Polymorphism: Different types of coffee can be implemented as subclasses of the Coffee class, allowing for easy addition of new coffee types without modifying existing code.

# Usage
To use the Coffee Making Simulation, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code: git clone https://github.com/EDOHWARES/coffee-machine-simulation

- Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd coffee-machine-oop
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the prompts to interact with the coffee making simulation.
